# exercise1_learning
This package includes GUI simulations and demo scripts for learning stable non-linear Dynamical Systems (DS) from demonstrations using LPV-DS [1] and SEDS [2] approaches developed in LASA-EPFL.

### Installing the exercise
Run the script ```setup_demo.m```

**Compatibility**: These exercise scripts have been tested in Matlab versions 2015a - 2018a.

### Running the gui for exercise sessions
- ```gui_lpvDS.m```: Brings up a GUI for estimation of Globally Asymptotically Stable Dynamical Systems focused on Linear Parameter Varying formulation with GMM-based mixing function and different Lyapunov candidate functions as proposed in [1], where a non-linear DS formulated as:

is learned from demonstrations in a decoupled manner. Where the GMM parameters <img src="https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt/blob/master/figs/img/theta_gamma.gif"> used to parametrize <img src="https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt/blob/master/figs/img/gamma.gif"> are estimated via the physically-consistent GMM approach proposed in [1] and provided in [phys-gmm](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/phys-gmm) and the DS parameters <img src="https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt/blob/master/figs/img/DS_params.gif"> are estimated via semi-definite optimization problem that ensures global asymptotic stability of the system via constraints derived from either a:

with different GMM estimation options:
- Manual K selection
- Model Selection with BIC
- PC-GMM [1]

- [Optional] ```gui_seDS.m```: Brings up a GUI for estimation of Globally Asymptotically Stable Dynamical Systems with the SEDS (constrained-GMR) [2] where a non-linear DS formulated as:

Whith the probability distribution being estimated with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). This GUI also includes robot simulation as above.

### Using algorithms on own data
Within the [ds_opt](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/icra19-lfd-tutorial-exercises/tree/master/exercise1_learning/ds-opt) folder, we provide demo scripts for using any of the presented learning algorithms on test 2D and 3D data. These scripts are useful if you want to learn DS with your own datasets.
